TSP evolution
  Randomly generate one path around the circuit
  Create a Generation of 20 circuits
    Randomly remove and replace one choice in each circuit
  Iterate through the generation of circuits and choose the shortest one
  Run through 100 generations
    each generation pick the shortest circuit to be the template for the next generation
